## Big Pain Points

Where do I click to activate it? Icon? Text? Empty space?
  The icon becomes the only safe bet.
  So icons should become bigger to make them tappable.

## Other

Collapse automatically?
  - Probably only if you have many items, because people are getting lost at that point. Otherwise, people like to have control.

If not enough space?
  - Don't hijack scrolling &mdash; disorienting.

Keep state on reload?
  - FAQ for sure.
  - Navigation drop-down, no.
