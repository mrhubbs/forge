Obvious: the always

Easy: the frequently, but not always

Possible: sometimes or rarely

Order according to this hierarchy.

Avoid plus icon, people click on it like mad.

## Mobile Considerations

With collapsible menus, it's a good idea for the close X to be in the same place as the opening menu.

On mobile, 75% of the interaction is done with the thumbs. Pressure varies a lot between fingers, changing touch target. Almost no-one hits mobile tap targets correctly.

The further away hit targets are from the center, the larger the padding should be (7-12mm). People prefer to tap **around** the center.

Obvious content should be in the middle.

## Search

Good to support search, with filter tags.

Iconography can help - e.g. searching for glasses by shape.
