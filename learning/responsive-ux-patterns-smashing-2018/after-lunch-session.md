# Friction

Vitaly thinks it's time to add friction to user experience, in certain places, to make them memorable.
  Sites need personality.
  Should do this consistently throughout pages.
  Making things a little bit broken gives personality.

Make boring interesting.
  Popups.

# Focus & Uniqueness

Be playful.

Customizable.

e.g. touch-timetable: book ticket by drawing line from one location tile to another.
  Can customize what locations are available.

Checkouts are painful when you have to all the way back through the steps to make a last-minute edit.
  Can make edits without leaving payment review page.

Illustrations should have different styles.
  Atlassian, Slack, etc. look similar.
  Illustrations just can't be on a white background.
    Need to make them work with background, color palette, typography, etc.

## Setting Up a Project

  1. Define components
  2. Define personality I want to convey
  3. Build prototype on the whiteboard, using magnets to stick elements together
    Pattern library is printed without
    Whiteboard is in center of a room, people notice it while walking by.
    Can do a component of the day (show and tell).
    Put them on back of stall doors in toilets.
      Within two months everyone knew components and sass variables, including the cleaning lady.

# Respect the User

Adding "dirt" or "hair" to the UI to trick people into touching the screen.

pand.co/cart had a free gift added to cart automatically. The quantity was unlimited. People got distracted playing with the quantity. Forgot about their item and then checked out automatically.
  Increased conversions massively.
  "honeypot"
